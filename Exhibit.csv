Jeffrey Ashley,The Ubiquitous Nature of Microplastic Fibers,"The research project was conducted to assess the levels of microplastics in the Atlantic ribbed mussel, an ecologically important species that feeds by passing large volumes of water through its gills to remove food. In the process of feeding, they also invertedly filter out microplastics from the water and accumulate them in their tissue. Our study found significant levels of microplastics, dominated by synthetic microfibers, in their tissues. Although humans do not typically eat this species, the same mechanism is used by oysters and may represent a human exposure route for microplastics. The image shows various microfibers observed under a digital microscope.lthough humans do not typically eat this species, the same mechanism is used by oysters and may represent a human exposure route for microplastics.

Alexandra Ciuciu,The Galaxies in our Bones,"My thesis project studies how non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs influence bone strength and fracture risk and this is an image I took of bone cells called osteocytes that have an extensive dendritic network and stellate shape. Their networks have always remind stars, so I colorized the image to look more like the pictures of galaxies that we commonly see.",Fire

Renee Walker,Temperature Quilt,"As temperatures warm around the globe, the Current Temp Quilt visualizes temperatures from different cities around the globe with jSON weather data. Like the feeling of heat on your skin, this display converts current temperature data to color values on a scale from cold to warm mapped with cooler temps in the blue-green range to hotter in the red-orange. The display allows for comparison among cities giving you an at a glance sense of what the world feels like right now.",Fire

William Morrison,MRI of Okra,"The project was part of an educational program I developed to train future Radiologists on MR Imaging machines - this training is quite unique since (at least in the US, and unlike what you see on TV, like 'House') doctors almost never actually work the machine. This is the purview of trained technologists. However, I learned how to operate MR imaging scanners many years ago, and I found that it helped me understand more about how to better diagnose disease on the patients' images - by understanding the physics involved in acquiring the images. I sought to teach the trainees this knowledge - so I arranged for weekly time on the scanner, and I invited them to participate on a voluntary basis. I asked each to bring a fruit, vegetable or something else they thought would be interesting to view on MRI. We had many valuable sessions! I collected many images over the years, and found many of them to be quite beautiful - so I colorized them using various filters and Photoshop to make an artistic rendering of the internal anatomy of the produce.",

Craig Griffen,"The Side Yard House; A New Typology for Affordable, Sustainable, Modular Mass Housing","Our current spate of social, economic and environmental crises all coalesce in the US housing crisis. Thirty percent of households have “unaffordable” housing payments. Population demographics are changing with greater demand for more affordable homes that don’t exist. And our climate is changing quickly but our homes’ energy efficiency is not improving fast enough. This new typology of smaller homes is adaptable to a range of locations, utilizes passive energy strategies, saves construction costs with modular prefabrication, and is thereby more affordable. All models share a common concept, based on the Charleston House Typology, that relocates the home along the site’s north edge to provide greater access to sunlight, fresh air, and green space. This orientation ensures all units have abundant sunlight for passive solar heating, daylighting and PV power. Operable windows for cross ventilation and passive shading from the overhanging balconies also increase the passive design strategies. The Side-Yard House was designed to be adaptable to three distinct rings of the city to address the specific needs of each area’s demographic. The SUBURBAN model is designed to combat suburban sprawl. The (sub)URBAN model is a hybrid that incorporates amenities of both suburban and city conditions. The URBAN model is a smaller home designed to fit in to dense urban infill pockets to combat gentrification. Because of the increasing costs of construction, all models of the Side-Yard House are designed to be premanufactured modular construction as this method is typically up to 20% less expensive than standard construction.",
